# PULSE — Global Situation Monitor

A real-time world events dashboard in a green-on-black "control room" style: earthquakes, wildfires, storms, volcanoes and world news, plotted live on a 3D globe, with a daily AI World Brief and personal watchlist alerts.

Inspired by [koala73/worldmonitor](https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor). Built end to end with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), using parallel sub-agents in separate git worktrees (see [How it was built](#how-it-was-built)).

## Features

- **3D globe** (MapLibre GL globe projection) that flattens into a street-level map as you zoom; clusters colored by severity, pulsing markers for severity 4+, fly-to, cursor lat/long readout
- **Live feed** over Supabase Realtime — new events appear without a refresh; filters for category, source, severity and time window live in the URL
- **SITREP panel** — UTC clock, threat index, category matrix, data-feed status, hotspots, priority traffic
- **Headline ticker** of the latest notable events
- **Stats** — events over time, by category, country, source and severity
- **World Brief** — a daily summary written by any OpenAI-compatible LLM (free tiers work), with an automatic extractive fallback when no key is set
- **Accounts, watchlists and alerts** — email/password or magic link; a Postgres trigger creates alerts when new events match your watchlists

## Architecture

```
pg_cron (every 10 min) ──POST /api/ingest──▶ ingesters (USGS, EONET, GDELT, RSS)
                                               │ fetchRaw → zod-validated normalize()
                                               ▼
                                   Postgres `events` (upsert on source+external_id)
                                     │                │ AFTER INSERT trigger
                        Supabase Realtime             ▼
                                     │          `alerts` for matching watchlists
                                     ▼
                     Browser: globe + live feed + SITREP (filters in URL)

pg_cron (daily) ──POST /api/brief──▶ select top events → LLM (or extractive) → `briefs`
```

- `lib/types.ts` — the shared `NormalizedEvent` contract every ingester outputs
- `lib/ingest/*` — one file per source, pure `normalize()` tested against saved fixtures
- `supabase/migrations/*` — schema, RLS policies, alert trigger, column grants
- `components/map/*` — MapLibre globe and the custom green vector style

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in your Supabase URL/keys and a random CRON_SECRET
# apply supabase/migrations/*.sql to your Supabase project (SQL editor or `supabase db push`)
npm run dev

# pull data once by hand:
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" http://localhost:3000/api/ingest
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" http://localhost:3000/api/brief
```

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test   # unit tests
npm run test:e2e                                # Playwright (builds + starts the app)
```

## How it was built

The project was built in phases with Claude Code, with independent modules developed **in parallel by sub-agents in isolated git worktrees**, then reviewed and merged by a lead agent:

1. **Foundation** — scaffold, shared types, Supabase clients, schema + RLS (sequential: it's the contract everything else builds on)
2. **Parallel build** — 4 agents at once: USGS+EONET ingesters · GDELT+RSS ingesters with geo/classify helpers · map + live feed · stats + brief pages
3. **Parallel build** — 3 agents: auth + watchlists + alert trigger · AI brief generator · Playwright e2e + CI
4. **Research agent** — compared free 3D globe options (MapLibre, globe.gl, deck.gl, Cesium) before the map was swapped
5. **Security review agent** before going public

Module ownership per agent is documented in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).
